For those interested in, I had started a project to make Symbian source code build again and I used to publish it on OSDN (https://osdn.net/users/jonebontus) but while working on that something terrible had happened, now OSDN is gone along with anything hosted in it.

I still have some of these files the ones I keep backup of it. Files such as binaries I'd build and other supporting files are lost!

- [PDK_3.0.4-src.7z](https://github.com/jonebontus/Symbian-old-stuff/raw/refs/heads/main/PDK_3.0.4-src.7z)
- [PDK_4.0.a-src.7z](https://github.com/jonebontus/Symbian-old-stuff/raw/refs/heads/main/PDK_4.0.a-src.7z)
